<center><h2>What is crop rotation?</center>
   
 </h2>
 <p>Crop rotation is the practice of planting different crops sequentially on the same plot of land to improve soil health, optimize nutrients in the soil, and combat pest and weed pressure.

For example, say a farmer has planted a field of corn. When the corn harvest is finished, he might plant beans, since corn consumes a lot of nitrogen and beans return nitrogen to the soil.

A simple rotation might involve two or three crops, and complex rotations might incorporate a dozen or more</p>

<h2>What are the Types of Crop Rotation</h2>
    
 <p>The growing of different crops on a piece of land in a pre-planned succession is called crop rotation.
Depending upon the duration, crop rotation may be of following three types</p>
<h3>One year rotation:- </h3>
<ol>
<li>Mustard-Sugarcane</li>
<li>Rice Wheat</li></ol>
<h3>Two years rotation:-</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Maize Mustard-Sugarcane Fenugreek</li>
    
  <li>Maize Potato- Sugarcane Peas</li></ol>
  <h3>Three years rotation:-</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Rice Wheat Mung Mustard</li>
<li>Sugar.cane Berseem</li>
<li>Cotton Oat Sugarcane Peas Maize Wheat</li>
  </ol>
  <h2>Selection of Crops of Rotation :</h2>
    <p>1.Source of moisture (through rain or irrigation)</p>
    <p>2.Status of nutrients in the soil</p>
    <p>3.Availability of inputs </p>
    <p>4.Duration of crop short or long</p>
    <p>5.Marketing and processing facilities</p>

<h2>1.Winter( December, January and February) :</h2>

<h2><i>WINTER VEGETABLES IN INDIA:-</i></h2>
<img src="shutterstock.jpg" width="350px" height="300px">
<p>Indian winter is the best season to grow a variety of vegetables in your kitchen garden. This growing season is also known as the Rabi season. In fact, some vegetables in India are only grown as Rabi crops.</p>
<h2>Lets peek at some of the best vegetables that can be grown during the winter in India:</h2>
<img src="Organic-vegetables.jpg" width="350px" height="300px">

<p><h3>1.Cauliflower:</p></h3>
<p>A popular vegetable of the cabbage family. Seeds are first sown in seedbeds or seedling trays under shade. Healthy seedlings are later transplanted on raised beds after 30-35 days of sowing. Plants need cool climate & full sunlight to form big cauliflower heads. 85-90 days after transplantation, ‘cauliflower curd’ should be ready to harvest. Cauliflower may have the trouble of ‘bolting’ (Early flowering, no curd), or ‘Buttoning (small non-edible heads) if conditions are unfavorable. Good seed, proper season, the cool, moist atmosphere around the vegetable is a must.</p>

<h3>2.Capsicum (Bell Pepper):</h3>
<p>These non-pungent varieties of chili known locally as Simla Mirch are successfully grown in Indian plains in winter. Plants are transplanted on raised beds four weeks after seed sowing in seedling trays. Plants require full sunlight; however, production is much higher when grown under green shade net house or poly-house. Plants are delicate and susceptible to diseases. Harvesting can begin 70-80 days after seed sowing.</p>

<h3>3.Spinach (Palak):</h3>
<p>A leafy vegetable popular for its nutritive value, easy to grow & ready availability. It does well in a cool climate, full sunlight as well as partial shade (3-4 hours). Seed are sown directly in raised beds. Harvesting of greens can be done within 30 days of seed sowing. Only 3 gm seeds are required per 100 sq. ft. area. Read more on Growing spinach

<h2>4.Monsoon: (Varsha Ritu)</h2><h2>Kharif Crops: Top 5 Crops to Grow in Monsoon Seaso:-</h2>
<h2>1.Rice</h2>

<img src="farmers.jpg" width="350px" height="300px">
<img src="IMG_20210627_002642.jpg" width="380px" height="320px"
<p>India is one of the world’s largest producers of rice & brown rice. It covers as much as one-third of the total cultivated area of India & provides to more than half of the Indian populations. Though, it is cultivated in most of the Indian states but the major 3 producers of rice are West Bengal, Punjab, and Uttar Pradesh. India being the highest producer of rice is considered as a top crop to grow in Monsoon. It requires an average temperature of 25-26 degrees Celsius & a minimum of 100cm of rainfall. Out of all the cities, Punjab & Haryana grow priced rice for export purposes.</p>
<h2>2.cotton</h2>

<p>Cotton is another Kharif crop, a tropical & subtropical crop. Cotton is considered as a fiber crop. Its seed is used as vegetable oil. India comes in third position in the production of cotton worldwide and popularly known as “White Gold”. Cotton is a range of long, medium & short staple variety of Kharif crops. The temperature required to grow cotton is 21-30 degrees Celsius & a minimum of 50-100cm of rainfall. The major producers of cotton among states are Gujarat, Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh, Haryana, Rajasthan, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, and Orissa. According to the previous report, Gujarat is the highest of all. Monsoon delivers about 75% of rainfall which is required for cotton production.</p>
<h2>3.Sugarcane</h2>
<img src="57170379-sugarcane-plants-gro-in-field.jpg" width="350px" height="300px">
<p>Sugarcane is grown in tropical & subtropical area which is an ancient crop of the Austronesian and Papuan people. Almost 79% of the sugar is produced from sugarcane. Few other products derived from sugarcane include falernum, molasses, rum, ethanol, etc. Sugarcane is only grown in monsoon season. It also requires hot & humid weather and agro climatic regions.</p>
<h2>4.Tea</h2>
<img src="51nx-sBF9L.jpg" width="350px" height="300px">
<p>India is the second largest producer of tea in the world. We are also the largest consumer of tea & uses around 30% of the global production output. Tea production is huge and in great demand. It can usually grow from subtropical to tropical climates in different parts of the country. Its plantation is very dynamic in nature & can handle high frost and snow. </p>
<h2>5.Pulses</h2>

<p>Crops like green gram, black gram, are the most important leading crops of India in monsoon. Though late monsoon slows the Kharif crops sowing and due to monsoon the production may be delayed & damaged. The main pulses growing states include Karnataka, Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh.</p>


<h2>5.Autumn: (Sharad Ritu)</h2>

             <h2>The Benefits of Crop Rotation and Diversity:</h2>
         <p>Crop rotation has long been considered an important farm practice. In 2013 producers had to stray from their well thought out crop rotations when the winter wheat crop in South Dakota failed. This may still be affecting many producers in central and western South Dakota. Crop rotation, or the planned sequence of specific crops in a field, can require additional planning and management for farmers. However the benefits of good crop rotation are numerous and include reduced soil erosion and improved soil water management, soil tilth, and fertility.

Crop rotation can also reduce pest issues and reliance on pesticides. Rotations also allow farmers to spread their workload and better utilize labor and machinery resources. The risk from weather related incidents can also be reduced with a good crop rotation.

There are a number of basic principles to consider when determining a crop rotation. One basic principle is crop water use. Crops such as sunflowers and corn are considered high water use and can draw soil water to very low levels at harvest The success of crops planted after a high water use crop will be determined in part by weather and the amount of precipitation received, caught, and infiltrated between harvest of the high-water-use crop and seeding and/or moisture sensitive periods of the succeeding crop. In all cropping systems water use must match water availability. If the system is not sufficiently intense problems such as water logging, saline seep formation, nutrient loss, traffic ability problems, etc. are common. If the system is too intense, poor yields due to water stress or stand establishment problems are likely.</p>
